# SpendWise AI — Free AI Tool Spend Audit

SpendWise AI is a free web app for startup founders and engineering managers to audit their AI tool subscriptions — finding overspend, suggesting cheaper alternatives, and surfacing savings in under 60 seconds. No login required. Built as a lead-generation asset for [Credex](https://credex.rocks).

🔗 **Live:** https://spendwise-ai-nine.vercel.app

## Decisions

Five meaningful trade-offs made during the build:

1. **Hardcoded audit rules over AI inference for the audit engine.**
   The audit math (plan comparisons, seat-count logic, alternative recommendations) is deterministic rule-based logic, not LLM-generated. This makes results auditable, consistent, and fast. AI is used only for the personalized summary paragraph — the one place where natural language genuinely adds value.

2. **In-memory store over a hosted database.**
   Audit results and leads are stored server-side in memory (via `lib/store.ts`) rather than Supabase or Postgres. This eliminates infra setup time and keeps the project zero-dependency for deployment. The trade-off: data doesn't survive server restarts. For a production launch, this would be swapped for Supabase with a single schema change.

3. **No form state persistence across page reloads.**
   Form state lives in React `useState` only. Persisting to `localStorage` was considered but skipped to avoid over-engineering an MVP. Users rarely reload mid-form; the cost of losing state is low relative to the complexity of hydration-safe localStorage sync in Next.js.

4. **Honeypot field for abuse protection over hCaptcha.**
   A hidden `website` field silently accepts and discards bot submissions. This blocks the majority of automated form spam with zero UX friction and no third-party dependency. hCaptcha would be added before a high-traffic launch.

5. **React state for audit result routing instead of a separate `/results` page.**
   Results render on the same page by toggling state (`auditResult` null/set), keeping the URL clean for the unauthenticated flow. The shareable URL uses a separate `/audit/[id]` route so sharing still works. This avoids a full-page navigation for the primary happy path, making the experience feel instant.
